**iFlowId**: ABAP_Proxy_de_XI_migrado - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.0

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required
   The iflow contains steps named "SetReceiver" and "Set Header and Message Type", which are generic names.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
   The iflow sets `SAP_Sender` and `SAP_Receiver` standard headers. It's missing `SAP_MessageType`. Also, `SAP_ApplicationID` standard header is not being set.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
   No custom headers are defined.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游댮 Check Required
   The metainfo.prop contains a description. However, source and target metadata values are missing.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in MANIFEST.MF (ABAP_Proxy_de_XI_migrado) uses underscores. It should use java style notation with dots (e.g. com.example.abapproxy).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游댮 Check Required
   The iflow uses parameters (e.g., QueueName_outbound, Address_inbound, fileName, path, host, username, password). These parameters are externalized with double curly braces `{{parameter}}` and require proper configuration during deployment.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok
   The iflow includes exception sub-processes.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok
   The iflow does not contain local scripts. Thus there is no use of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok
   The iflow does not have more than 10 "callActivity" in the same "SequenceFlow"

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok
   The iflow does not contain local scripts. Thus there is no use of `messageLogFactory`.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply
   The iflow is triggered by a `XI` message, so IDoc rules do not apply

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply
   The flow writes to a file. It could be usefull to log the file name as a custom header.
