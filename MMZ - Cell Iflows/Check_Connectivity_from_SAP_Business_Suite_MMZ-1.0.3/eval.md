**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

-

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming**: The iFlow contains steps with default names like "Start" and "End". The mapping step is named "Mapping", which is a generic name. Ideally, steps should be named descriptively to reflect their specific function within the iFlow.

    - **Monitoring Standard Headers**:  The BPMN XML doesn't explicitly define usage of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.).  Without explicit header manipulation, it's unlikely these are being used.

    - **Monitoring Custom Headers**: The BPMN XML does not show evidence of setting custom headers for monitoring purposes. There are no Content Modifier steps or Groovy scripts used to add custom headers.

    - **Iflow Metadata**: The metainfo.prop file contains values for description, source (SAPERP), and target (SAPCloudforCustomer), and SAP-MarkedSAP2SAP. This is good.

    - **Iflow Id**: The iFlow ID (Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ) matches the Bundle-SymbolicName in the MANIFEST.MF file. This is compliant with the recommended Java notation.

    - **Parameter Externalization**: The iFlow extensively uses externalized parameters (e.g., `{{ERP_address_1}}`, `{{Host}}`, `{{Port}}`, `{{artifactname}}`).  Authentication data and URLs are externalized. This is a good practice.

    - **Error Handling**: The provided code snippets don't show explicit error handling within the iFlow. There are no exception sub-processes, or Try/Catch blocks.  Error handling appears to be missing.
