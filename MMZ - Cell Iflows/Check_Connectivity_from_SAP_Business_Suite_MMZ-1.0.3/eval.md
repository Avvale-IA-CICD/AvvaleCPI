**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** 游댮
The iFlow contains a "callActivity" named "Mapping". It's recommended to rename this with a more descriptive name related to the mapping content or purpose.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** 游댮
The iFlow doesn't appear to explicitly set or utilize standard monitoring headers like SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, or SAP_ApplicationID in its current configuration.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** 游댮
The iFlow doesn't appear to explicitly use custom headers for enhanced payload search and filtering.
- **Iflow Metadata** 游릭
The file metainfo.prop is populated with source, target, and description values.
- **Iflow Id** 游댮
The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF uses underscores: "Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ". It should use Java notation with dots instead of underscores, e.g., "com.sap.connectivity.check".
- **Parameter Externalization** 游릭
The iFlow externalizes several parameters, including address, wsdlURL, enableBasicAuthentication, artifactname, pr-key-alias, Host, and Port using double curly braces {{}}.
- **Error Handling** 游댮
The iFlow doesn't seem to implement explicit error handling mechanisms within its steps.
- **Local Script Security** 游릭
The provided information contains no scripts, so it is not possible to check for classes from the packages com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore.
- **Iflow Organization** 游릭
The iFlow uses only one "callActivity" within the "SequenceFlow", so the number of steps is less than 10.
- **Iflow Attachments** 游릭
No groovy scripts have been included, so it is not possible to check use of class messageLogFactory.
- **IDoc Rules** 游리
This iFlow does not seem to be processing IDocs.
- **File Rules** 游리
This iFlow does not seem to be processing Files.
