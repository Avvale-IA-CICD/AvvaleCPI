**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** : N/A :red_circle:
   The iFlow contains one `callActivity` named "Mapping".  This is better than the default name, but it could be improved by specifying the functionality the step is performing.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** : N/A :red_circle:
   The iFlow does not explicitly set or use standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.).

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** : N/A :red_circle:
   The iFlow does not explicitly set or use custom monitoring headers.

- **Iflow Metadata** : OK :green_circle:
   The `metainfo.prop` file is populated with `description`, `source`, and `target`.

- **Iflow Id** : CHECK :yellow_circle:
   The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is "Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ". While it follows the general format, it uses underscores which is not a best practice for java package notation and is against SAP Guidelines.

- **Parameter Externalization** : OK :green_circle:
   The iFlow externalizes parameters such as address, wsdlURL, enableBasicAuthentication, artifactname, Host and Port as indicated by the `{{...}}` notation within the BPMN XML.

- **Error Handling** : N/A :red_circle:
   The iFlow does not contain explicit error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception subprocesses, exception flows).

- **Local Script Security** : N/A :green_circle:
   No local script content was found, so this check is not applicable.

- **Iflow Organization** : OK :green_circle:
   The iFlow has a simple structure with only one `callActivity` in the `SequenceFlow`.

- **Iflow Attachments** : N/A :green_circle:
   No local script content was found, so no usage of `messageLogFactory` could be detected.

- **IDoc Rules** : N/A :green_circle:
   The iFlow is a SOAP-based iFlow. So this check is not applicable.

- **File Rules** : N/A :green_circle:
   The iFlow is a SOAP-based iFlow. So this check is not applicable.
