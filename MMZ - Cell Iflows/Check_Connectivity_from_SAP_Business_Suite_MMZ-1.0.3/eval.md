**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow contains a `callActivity` named "Mapping". While this isn't a default name like "Content Modifier," it's generic. Ideally, it should be more descriptive of the specific mapping being performed.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The provided XML doesn't show any explicit setting of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, SAP_ApplicationID, etc.). Their usage cannot be determined from the code extract, but their absence suggests a possible gap in monitoring.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The provided XML doesn't show any explicit setting of custom headers. This may indicate a lack of enhanced payload search and filtering capabilities.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
The `metainfo.prop` file contains `source`, `target`, and `description` metadata.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游릭 Ok\
The `MANIFEST.MF` file's `Bundle-SymbolicName` (`Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`) uses underscores. This is valid.
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow uses externalized parameters (e.g., `{{ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8}}`, `{{ERP_address_1}}`, `{{ERP_wsdlURL_0}}`, `{{Host}}`, `{{Port}}`, `{{COD_enableBasicAuthentication_6}}`, `{{artifactname}}`, `{{pr-key-alias}}`). This is good for configuration management.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The BPMN XML does not show any explicit error handling mechanisms (e.g., error events, exception subprocesses). This suggests a potential lack of robust error management.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
No usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` is found in the provided scripts.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow has only one `callActivity` within the main `SequenceFlow`, which is well below the threshold of 10.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
No evidence of using `messageLogFactory` to create attachments is found.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow appears to be a simple connectivity check using SOAP, not IDocs.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow does not seem to involve any file processing.
