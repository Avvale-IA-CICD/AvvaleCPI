**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming**
	 The iFlow contains a "callActivity" named "Mapping". This is a good practice.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers**
	 There is no explicit use of Standard Headers for monitoring evident in the provided code. This should be considered for review

- **Monitoring Custom Headers**
	 There is no explicit use of Custom Headers for monitoring evident in the provided code. This should be considered for review

- **Iflow Metadata**
	 The `metainfo.prop` file is populated with source, target, and description. This is a good practice.

- **Iflow Id**
	 The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. This does not follow Java package naming conventions (using dots instead of underscores). This is a point for review.

- **Parameter Externalization**
	 Several parameters are externalized using placeholders like `{{ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{issuer}}`, `{{ERP_address_1}}`, `{{ERP_wsdlURL_0}}`, `{{Host}}`, `{{Port}}`, `{{COD_enableBasicAuthentication_6}}`, `{{artifactname}}`, and `{{pr-key-alias}}`. This is a good practice.

- **Error Handling**
	 There is no explicit error handling implemented in the iFlow steps evident in the provided code.

- **Script Security**
	 No use of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages is detected in the scripts.

- **Iflow Organization**
	 The iFlow contains only one "callActivity" element, so the number of 10 "callActivity" is not exceeded. This is a good practice.

- **Iflow Attachments**
	 No evidence of attachment creation using `messageLogFactory` during groovy scripting is found in the scripts.
