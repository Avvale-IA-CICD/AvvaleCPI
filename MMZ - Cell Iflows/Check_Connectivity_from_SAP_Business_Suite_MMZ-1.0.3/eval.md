**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok
    No default names like "Sender", "Receiver", "Content Modifier", etc. are used for the callActivity. The callActivity is named "Mapping".

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The iFlow definition doesn't explicitly show the usage of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, SAP_ApplicationID). Manual review is required to confirm if these headers are used within scripts or mapping.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The iFlow definition does not show explicit usage of custom headers. Manual review is required to check for custom header usage inside the mapping or any scripts (none provided).

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source (SAPERP), target (SAPCloudforCustomer) and description (Check Connectivity with SAP Business Suite).

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The `MANIFEST.MF` shows `Bundle-SymbolicName: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. According to best practices, the symbolic name should follow Java notation (using dots instead of underscores or hyphens). This needs to be changed to something like `com.sap.connectivity.check`.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok
    The iFlow uses externalized parameters denoted by double curly braces `{{...}}` for adapter configurations (e.g., addresses, credentials, authentication).

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The provided BPMN XML does not show explicit error handling. A manual check is needed to verify if any error handling is implemented within the mapping or the integration process.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok
    No local scripts are included, and the `MANIFEST.MF` doesn't suggest imports from `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok
    There is only one call activity in the iFlow.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok
    No scripts are provided, and therefore there are no attachments created using `messageLogFactory`.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply
    The iFlow description refers to connectivity check, and the SOAP adapter configuration doesn't mention anything about IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply
    The iFlow doesn't seem to be processing files directly based on the adapters used.
