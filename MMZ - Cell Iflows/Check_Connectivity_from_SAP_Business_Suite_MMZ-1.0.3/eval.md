**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok
    The iFlow only contains a "CallActivity" named "Mapping," which is acceptable. There are no generic names like "Content Modifier" or "Router."
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The iFlow definition does not provide information about setting or using Standard Headers for monitoring.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The iFlow definition does not provide information about setting or using Custom Headers for monitoring to enhance payload search and filtering.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok
    The metainfo.prop file contains values for source, target, and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF (Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ) uses underscores, which is against java notation best practices. It should use dots instead (e.g., Check.Connectivity.from.SAP.Business.Suite.MMZ).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok
    The iFlow uses externalized parameters (e.g., {{ERP_address_1}}, {{Host}}, {{Port}}, {{artifactname}}), indicating that important parameters are being externalized.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The iFlow definition does not provide information about any explicit error handling mechanisms within the iFlow steps.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok
    No scripts are present in the provided data, so there are no uses of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` classes.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok
    The iFlow has only one `callActivity`, so it does not violate the threshold of more than 10 `callActivity` elements in the same `SequenceFlow`.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok
    No scripts are present in the provided data, so `messageLogFactory` class is not being used for creating attachments.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply
    The iFlow does not appear to be processing IDocs.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply
    The iFlow does not appear to be processing Files.
