iFlowId: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - iFlowVersion:1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming**

 The iFlow step "CallActivity_1" has a descriptive name ("Mapping"). No generic names were found.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers**

 The BPMN XML does not explicitly define the use of standard monitoring headers such as `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, `SAP_MessageType`, or `SAP_ApplicationID`.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers**

 The BPMN XML does not explicitly define the use of custom headers for monitoring purposes.

- **Iflow Metadata**

 The `metainfo.prop` file contains metadata for source (SAPERP), target (SAPCloudforCustomer) and description (Check Connectivity with SAP Business Suite).

- **Iflow Id**

 The Iflow ID is "Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ", and it matches the Bundle-SymbolicName in the MANIFEST.MF file.  The developer is using a valid naming convention for the Iflow ID.

- **Parameter Externalization**

 The iFlow leverages externalized parameters denoted by double curly braces (e.g., `{{ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{issuer}}`, `{{ERP_address_1}}`, `{{ERP_wsdlURL_0}}`, `{{Host}}`, `{{Port}}`, `{{COD_enableBasicAuthentication_6}}`, `{{artifactname}}`, `{{pr-key-alias}}`). This is a good practice for managing configuration and security.

- **Error Handling**

 The provided XML does not have explicit error handling logic defined within the iFlow steps.

- **Script Security**

 No scripts are provided and the MANIFEST.MF does not include imports from `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`, so there is no security issue.

- **Iflow Organization**

 The longest sequence flow contains two "callActivity", which is less than 10. Therefore, there is no readibility issue.

- **Iflow Attachments**

 Groovy scripts are not used, so there is no risk of creating attachments during scripting making use of class messageLogFactory.
