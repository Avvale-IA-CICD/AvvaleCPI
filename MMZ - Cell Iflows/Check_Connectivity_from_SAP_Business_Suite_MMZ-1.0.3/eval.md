**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The iFlow contains a "callActivity" named "Mapping". While not a default name like "Content Modifier", it is a generic name. A more descriptive name would improve understanding.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The provided information doesn't indicate the use of standard headers for monitoring. Checking the iFlow implementation is required to confirm whether SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, or SAP_ApplicationID are being used.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The provided information doesn't show any custom headers used for monitoring. This needs verification within the iFlow's logic.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` uses underscores: `Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. It should be in Java notation using dots (e.g., `com.sap.connectivity.check`).

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok
    The iFlow has a simple structure with only one `callActivity` between the start and end events.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok
    No scripts are provided. Therefore, no attachment creation using `messageLogFactory` is detected.
