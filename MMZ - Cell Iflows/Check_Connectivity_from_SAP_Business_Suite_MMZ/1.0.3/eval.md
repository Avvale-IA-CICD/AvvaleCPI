**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow only contains one `callActivity` named "Mapping". This is an acceptable name.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not explicitly set or log standard headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, SAP_ApplicationID). A check should be made to ensure that the relevant data is being monitored.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not explicitly set any custom headers. A check should be made to determine if any custom headers are needed to enhance payload search and filtering.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The metainfo.prop file contains values for source, target and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF is "Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ". This should be in java class style notation (e.g., com.sap.check.cod.connectivity).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes several parameters such as URLs, authentication data, and host information.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not contain explicit error handling logic. A check should be performed to assess if error handling is sufficient for this flow.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There are no local scripts used. No secure store or key store classes can be found.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow contains only one `callActivity`. The "SequenceFlow" doesn췂t have readibility issues.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow does not use `messageLogFactory` in groovy scripts to create attachments.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to be processing IDocs.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to be processing files directly.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow has an SOAP Sender adapter, and it seems that "ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8" is set to true, check the security implications, ESBMessaging.send role usage should be avoided.
