**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow contains a "callActivity" named "Mapping", which is acceptable.  However, it's important to ensure all other steps have descriptive names.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML does not show evidence of using standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.).  A review of the mapping and any scripts is required to confirm.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML does not show evidence of usage of custom headers.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file is present and populates the description, source, and target fields.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. This violates the Java naming convention.  It should use dots instead of underscores or hyphens (e.g., `com.sap.connectivity.check`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses externalized parameters for addresses, authentication details, and other configuration elements, which is good practice.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML doesn't explicitly show error handling.  A review of the mapping and any scripts is required to confirm error handling implementation.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There are no local scripts used in the iFlow.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow does not have more than 10 callActivities in the same SequenceFlow.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow does not use groovy scripts, so attachments are not created.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow does not appears to process IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow does not appears to process Files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iflow exposes a SOAP endpoint from ERP with Basic Authentication enabled (`ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8=true`). This configuration requires a security review to ensure it is not using ESBMessaging.send role, either hardcoded in BPMN XML or in Configured values.
