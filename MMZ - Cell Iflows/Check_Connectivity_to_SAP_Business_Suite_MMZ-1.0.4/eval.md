**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iflow contains a "callActivity" named "Mapping". While not a standard name like "Sender" or "Receiver", it's generic. A more descriptive name (e.g., "Map_COD_to_ERP") would improve clarity.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The provided XML doesn't show explicit usage of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.).  It's important to implement these headers for proper monitoring.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The provided XML doesn't show explicit usage of custom monitoring headers. Implementing custom headers to enhance payload search and filtering would be beneficial.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The `metainfo.prop` file is populated with `source`, `target`, and `description`, which is good.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. It should follow Java package naming conventions (e.g., `com.sap.connectivity.check`). The use of underscores is not recommended.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iflow utilizes externalized parameters (e.g., `{{COD_address_2}}`, `{{COD_wsdlURL_1}}`, `{{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}`, `{{Client}}`, `{{artifactname}}`, `{{location-id}}`) which is good.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The provided XML does not show any explicit error handling mechanisms implemented within the iflow process. Error handling is crucial for robust integration.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The provided information does not contain scripts, so there is no usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iflow has only one "callActivity" within the main sequence flow, so it does not surpass the 10 limit.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The provided information does not contain scripts, so there is no usage of `messageLogFactory`.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow processes SOAP messages, not IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow does not directly handle files.
