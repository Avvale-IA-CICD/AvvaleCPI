**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iflow contains a 'CallActivity' named "Mapping". While not a standard name like "Sender" or "Receiver", it's generic and could benefit from a more descriptive name.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The provided BPMN XML doesn't explicitly show the use of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.).  A review of any included scripts would be needed to confirm if these headers are being used.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The provided BPMN XML doesn't show evidence of custom monitoring headers. A deeper inspection of any scripts would be required to determine if custom headers are being used for payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ) uses underscores instead of the recommended java class style notation using dots.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The BPMN XML shows externalized parameters using the `{{...}}` notation, such as `{{COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{issuer}}`, `{{COD_address_2}}`, `{{COD_wsdlURL_1}}`, `{{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}`, `{{Client}}`, `{{ERP_proxyType_4}}`, `{{location-id}}`, `{{ERP_authentication_5}}`, `{{artifactname}}`, `{{ERP_allowChunking_3}}`, `{{ERP_cleanupHeaders_2}}`, `{{p-key-alias}}`, indicating parameter externalization.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The BPMN XML doesn't contain explicit error handling steps. Further examination of scripts or process design is necessary to determine if error handling is implemented.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The provided information does not show the usage of classes from the packages `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iflow contains one `callActivity`, which is less than 10.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No scripts were provided, assuming developer is not creating attachments using `messageLogFactory`.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow description suggests a connectivity test, not necessarily involving IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow description suggests a connectivity test, not necessarily involving files.
