**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The iFlow contains a `CallActivity` named "Mapping". It is recommended to provide more descriptive names to Iflow steps.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The provided XML does not show explicit usage of standard monitoring headers.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The provided XML does not show explicit usage of custom monitoring headers.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok
    The `metainfo.prop` file is populated with source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ) uses underscores, which is not the recommended java class style notation. It should use dots instead.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok
    The iFlow externalizes parameters using `{{...}}` notation (e.g., `{{COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3}}`, `{{COD_address_2}}`).

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required
    The provided XML doesn't show any explicit error handling mechanisms.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游댮 Check Required
    No scripts are provided, so no security check on insecure packages such as com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore can be performed.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok
    The iFlow uses a small number of `callActivity` steps within a single `SequenceFlow`.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required
     No scripts are provided, so no attachments check making use of class messageLogFactory during groovy scripting can be performed.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply
    The iFlow doesn't seem to be handling IDocs based on the provided information.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply
    The iFlow doesn't seem to be handling files based on the provided information.
