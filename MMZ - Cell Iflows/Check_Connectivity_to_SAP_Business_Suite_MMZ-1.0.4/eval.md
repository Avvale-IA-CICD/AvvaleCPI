**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There are no callActivity steps with default names like "Sender", "Receiver", etc. The only `callActivity` is named "Mapping".
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not explicitly set or use standard monitoring headers like SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc., within the provided XML.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not explicitly set custom headers for monitoring within the provided XML.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The Bundle-SymbolicName in `MANIFEST.MF` (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ) uses underscores instead of the recommended java class style notation with dots.
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    Multiple parameters like URLs, authentication details, and client information are externalized using variables.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow definition does not explicitly show any error handling mechanisms.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There are no local scripts, so there is no usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` classes.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There is only one callActivity, so the number of callActivities in a SequenceFlow is not an issue.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There are no local scripts, so there is no logging with messageLogFactory.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs based on the provided information.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process files based on the provided information.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The COD sender adapter has `COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3=true`. This requires further checking to ensure appropriate security measures are in place instead of the deprecated Basic Authentication.
