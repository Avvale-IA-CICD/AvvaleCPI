**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
  All `callActivity` elements have meaningful names ("Mapping").

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The iFlow does not explicitly define or manipulate standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.). Need to verify if headers are being used for monitoring.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The iFlow does not explicitly define or manipulate custom monitoring headers. Need to verify if custom headers are being used for monitoring.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The `metainfo.prop` file contains `description`, `source`, and `target` metadata.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. This should follow Java naming conventions using dots (e.g., `com.sap.check.connectivity`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow extensively uses externalized parameters (e.g., URLs, authentication details, client information) within the message flow properties and participant properties.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The BPMN XML representation of the iFlow does not provide information about error handling implementation in the mapping step or any global exception process. Need to investigate.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
  There are no local scripts in the provided text. Also there is no reference to com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow has only one `callActivity` in the `SequenceFlow`, so it does not exceed the limit of 10.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
  There is no usage of `messageLogFactory` found in the provided content.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
  The iFlow deals with SOAP messages, not IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
  The iFlow does not seem to process files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The iFlow exposes an endpoint via a SOAP sender adapter (`Participant_1`). It's configured to allow Basic Authentication (`COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3=true`), which is generally considered insecure. Review if the iFlow is also using `ESBMessaging.send` role, either hardcoded in BPMN XML or configured values, that췂s considered insecure. Also, even if it has Basic Auth enabled, check if it's really needed.
