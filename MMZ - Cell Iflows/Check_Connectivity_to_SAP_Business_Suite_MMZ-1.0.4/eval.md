**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There is one "callActivity" named "Mapping", which is not a default name.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML doesn't explicitly show usage of standard monitoring headers.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML doesn't explicitly show usage of custom monitoring headers.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. It uses underscores, which is not the recommended Java notation.  It should be something like com.sap.check.connectivity.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses externalized parameters (e.g., `{{COD_address_2}}`, `{{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}`) for connection details, authentication, and other configurable values.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML does not show any explicit error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception subprocesses, error events).

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No local scripts were provided, so this check passed automatically.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow contains only one `callActivity` within the sequence flow.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No local scripts were provided, and it is not possible to confirm if attachment is being created via groovy scripting.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process files directly.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses a SOAP sender adapter and allows Basic Authentication (`COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3=true`). This configuration can be insecure if not properly protected. The `ESBMessaging.send` role usage check is not possible as the information is not present in the BPMN XML.
