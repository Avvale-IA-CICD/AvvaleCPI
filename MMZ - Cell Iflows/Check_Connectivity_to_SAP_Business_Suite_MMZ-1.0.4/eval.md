**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** 游댮
The iFlow contains a `callActivity` named "Mapping". This is not a default name, so this check is not applicable.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** 游리
The provided XML doesn't show explicit usage of standard headers for monitoring. Without examining any scripts, it's impossible to determine if these headers are being used. Further investigation is required.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** 游리
The provided XML does not show any evidence of custom header usage. Further investigation of scripts or mapping logic would be required to confirm.

- **Iflow Metadata** 游릭
The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `description`, `source`, and `target`.

- **Iflow Id** 游댮
The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. It uses underscores instead of the recommended Java notation (dots).

- **Parameter Externalization** 游릭
The iFlow externalizes many parameters such as COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3, subject, issuer, COD_address_2, COD_wsdlURL_1, Protocol-Hostname-Port, Client, ERP_proxyType_4, location-id, ERP_authentication_5, artifactname, ERP_allowChunking_3, ERP_cleanupHeaders_2, p-key-alias

- **Error Handling** 游리
The iFlow XML doesn't explicitly showcase any error handling mechanisms within the provided elements. Further investigation is required to check if error handling is present in any script or other steps.

- **Local Script Security** 游댮
No local scripts were provided to analyse if any security breach might exists. Further investigation is required to check the script's content.

- **Iflow Organization** 游릭
The iFlow has only one `callActivity`.

- **Iflow Attachments** 游댮
No local scripts were provided to analyse if attachments are created during groovy scripting. Further investigation is required to check the script's content.

- **IDoc Rules** 游리
The iFlow doesn't seem to be IDoc related.

- **File Rules** 游리
The iFlow doesn't seem to be File related.
