**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** 游댮
The iFlow contains a step named "Mapping" which should be more descriptive. It should be renamed to better reflect the specific mapping being performed.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** 游댮
The iFlow does not explicitly set or use standard headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, SAP_ApplicationID) for monitoring. Implement monitoring standard headers in any of the iFlow steps.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** 游댮
The iFlow does not explicitly set or use custom headers for enhanced payload search and filtering. Implement Custom Headers in any of the iFlow steps to provide more context and facilitate searching and filtering of messages.

- **Iflow Metadata** 游릭
The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`, indicating that the iFlow metadata is populated.

- **Iflow Id** 游댮
The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in the `MANIFEST.MF` file is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. It should follow Java naming conventions using dots instead of underscores, for example, `com.example.connectivity.check`.

- **Parameter Externalization** 游릭
The iFlow externalizes parameters such as `COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3`, `subject`, `issuer`, `COD_address_2`, `COD_wsdlURL_1`, `Protocol-Hostname-Port`, `Client`, `ERP_proxyType_4`, `location-id`, `ERP_authentication_5`, `artifactname`, `ERP_allowChunking_3`, `ERP_cleanupHeaders_2`, and `p-key-alias`. This is a good practice.

- **Error Handling** 游댮
The iFlow does not appear to have any explicit error handling mechanisms implemented. Error handling should be implemented in the iflow steps

- **Local Script Security** 游릭
No usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages is found in the scripts (no scripts found).

- **Iflow Organization** 游릭
The iFlow contains a limited amount of "callActivity" in the same "SequenceFlow" (only 1 "callActivity" step).

- **Iflow Attachments** 游릭
The iFlow does not appear to use `messageLogFactory` to create attachments during Groovy scripting (no groovy scripts).

- **IDoc Rules** 游리
The iFlow doesn't seem to deal directly with IDocs, so this rule may not apply.

- **File Rules** 游리
The iFlow doesn't seem to deal directly with files, so this rule may not apply.
