**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming**
The iFlow contains a "callActivity" named "Mapping". While not a generic name like "Sender" or "Receiver," it's recommended to use more descriptive names reflecting the mapping's purpose for better maintainability.
Result: CHECK

- **Monitoring Standard Headers**
The provided XML doesn't explicitly show the use of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, SAP_ApplicationID, etc.). Their absence might hinder effective monitoring.
Result: CHECK

- **Monitoring Custom Headers**
The provided XML doesn't show explicit configuration for custom headers. Their inclusion can improve payload search and filtering.
Result: CHECK

- **Iflow Metadata**
The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`.
Result: OK

- **Iflow Id**
The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` (`Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`) uses underscores. It should ideally use Java-style notation with dots (e.g., `com.sap.connectivity.check`).
Result: CHECK

- **Parameter Externalization**
The iFlow externalizes several parameters using double curly braces `{{...}}`, indicating proper parameter externalization for configurations like addresses, credentials, and proxy settings.
Result: OK

- **Error Handling**
The provided XML doesn't show explicit error handling mechanisms within the iFlow steps.
Result: CHECK

- **Local Script Security**
No local scripts are provided. However, if local scripts are ever used and contain `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` classes, then it might represent a security issue.
Result: N/A

- **Iflow Organization**
The iFlow only contains one "callActivity".
Result: OK

- **Iflow Attachments**
No local scripts are provided. It is impossible to evaluate if the class messageLogFactory is being used.
Result: N/A
