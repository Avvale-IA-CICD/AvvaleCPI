**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming**
	The iFlow uses the standard name "Mapping" for a call activity. This should be renamed to a more descriptive name.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers**
	The iFlow does not explicitly set any standard SAP monitoring headers.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers**
	The iFlow does not explicitly set any custom monitoring headers.

- **Iflow Metadata**
	The iFlow metadata (source, target, description) is populated in the `metainfo.prop` file.

- **Iflow Id**
	The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ) uses underscores. It should use java package notation with dots (e.g., com.sap.connectivity.check).

- **Parameter Externalization**
	The iFlow externalizes several parameters, including authentication details, URLs, and location IDs, indicated by the `{{...}}` notation in the BPMN XML.

- **Error Handling**
	The iFlow does not appear to implement any explicit error handling mechanisms.

- **Script Security**
	There are no scripts used.

- **Iflow Organization**
	The iFlow contains only one `callActivity` in the main sequence flow, so the number of steps is not a readability issue.

- **Iflow Attachments**
	The iFlow does not appear to be creating any attachments in Groovy scripts using `messageLogFactory`.
