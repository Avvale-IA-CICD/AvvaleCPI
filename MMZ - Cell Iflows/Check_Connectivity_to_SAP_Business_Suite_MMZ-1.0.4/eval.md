**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok: The iflow step "CallActivity_1" is named "Mapping", which is not a standard name.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required: The iFlow XML doesn't explicitly show the usage of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.). Requires manual check of any scripts or content modifiers within the iflow.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required: The iFlow XML doesn't explicitly show the usage of custom monitoring headers. Requires manual check of any scripts or content modifiers within the iflow.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok: The metainfo.prop file contains source, target and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required: The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF uses underscores, this is not a java class style notation. Requires correction.
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok: The iflow extensively uses externalized parameters (e.g., {{COD_address_2}}, {{artifactname}}, {{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}), which is a good practice.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required: The iFlow XML doesn't show any explicit error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception subprocesses, error end events). Requires manual check of the iflow steps.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok: There is no evidence of usage from packages "com.sap.it.api.securestore" or "com.sap.it.api.keystore".
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok: The iflow contains only one "callActivity" inside the "SequenceFlow".
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok: The analysis did not detect evidence of messageLogFactory class usage during groovy scripting.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply: This iFlow doesn't seem to involve IDoc processing based on the provided XML.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply: This iFlow doesn't seem to involve File processing based on the provided XML.
