**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow step "CallActivity_1" is named "Mapping", which is more descriptive than the default names.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The provided XML doesn't show any explicit usage of standard monitoring headers like SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc. It's recommended to include these for better monitoring.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The provided XML doesn't show any explicit usage of custom monitoring headers. Adding custom headers relevant to the payload would improve search and filtering capabilities.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The `metainfo.prop` file is populated with source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ) uses underscores.  It should be in Java notation (e.g., com.sap.check.cod.connectivity).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow externalizes several parameters such as endpoint addresses, authentication details, and proxy settings.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The provided XML doesn't show any explicit error handling within the iFlow steps. Implementing error handling (e.g., using a message mapping to transform errors into a standard format, or using a retry mechanism) is recommended for robust integration.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
  No local scripts are provided, so no security concerns are present regarding `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow has only one call activity.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow does not appear to be creating attachments in Groovy scripts using `messageLogFactory`.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
  The iFlow doesn't explicitly process IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
  The iFlow doesn't explicitly process files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The Participant_1 exposes an endpoint using SOAP Sender Adapter and the COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3 parameter is set to true. Check if the iflow uses Basic Auth and if the ESBMessaging.send role is used, either hardcoded in BPMN XML or in Configured values. This configuration is considered insecure.
