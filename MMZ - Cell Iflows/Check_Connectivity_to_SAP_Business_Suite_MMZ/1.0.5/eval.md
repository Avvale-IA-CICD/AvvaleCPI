**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
 The iflow steps are not using default names like "Sender", "Receiver", or "Content Modifier". The `CallActivity` is named "Mapping".

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow does not explicitly set or use standard monitoring headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, or `SAP_MessageType`. Review and implement monitoring headers as needed.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow does not explicitly set or use custom headers for monitoring. Consider adding custom headers to improve payload search and filtering capabilities.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
The `metainfo.prop` file contains metadata for `source`, `target`, and `description`.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_MMZ`. It should follow Java naming conventions (e.g., `com.sap.check.connectivity`) using dots instead of underscores.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
Important parameters such as URLs (`Protocol-Hostname-Port`, `COD_address_2`), authentication details (`ERP_authentication_5`, `artifactname`, `p-key-alias`, `Client`, `subject`, `issuer`), and connection settings (`ERP_proxyType_4`, `location-id`) are externalized as configurable parameters.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow does not explicitly implement error handling within its steps. Evaluate if error handling is needed to gracefully handle failures.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
No local scripts are present, and therefore there is no use of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` classes.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow has only one `callActivity` inside the `SequenceFlow`.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow does not use `messageLogFactory` for creating attachments in Groovy scripts.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow doesn't appear to be processing IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow doesn't appear to be processing Files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow exposes an endpoint with SOAP Sender Adapter, and is configured to allow Basic Authentication (`COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3=true`). Ensure that Basic Authentication is only enabled if needed and that proper security measures are in place.  Also, ensure the iFlow doesn't hardcode `ESBMessaging.send` role within the BPMN or configured values which will be insecure.
