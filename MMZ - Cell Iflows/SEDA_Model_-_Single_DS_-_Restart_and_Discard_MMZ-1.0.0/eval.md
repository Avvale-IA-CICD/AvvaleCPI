**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.0

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    *   The iFlow contains call activities with generic names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Set Headers", "Custom Status" and "Log Async Exception". These names should be more descriptive to improve readability.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *   The iFlow utilizes standard headers for monitoring purposes such as `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType`.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *   The iFlow uses custom headers like `Step` for routing, which enhances payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    *   The description field in `metainfo.prop` is empty. Populating this field will improve iFlow documentation. Source and Target information are missing as well.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    *   The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`. It should follow Java notation using dots and avoid underscores or hyphens (e.g., `com.example.seda.model`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *   The iFlow externalizes important parameters such as Data Store Name, Poll Interval, Retry Interval, Lock Timeout, Maximum Retry Interval, Exponential Backoff, and Retention Thresholds using placeholders `{{...}}`.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *   The iFlow implements error handling using Error Event Subprocesses in multiple integration processes including "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "SEDA Router", and "Trigger Exception".

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *   The iFlow does not appear to use classes from the `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages in the provided scripts.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *   The iFlow does not exceed 10 "callActivity" in the same "SequenceFlow".

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *   The provided code does not indicate usage of `messageLogFactory` for creating attachments.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    *   There's no indication of IDoc processing in this iFlow.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    *   There's no indication of File processing in this iFlow.
