**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    Some call activities have standard names like "Set Headers", "Custom Status". This should be reviewed.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses standard headers such as SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, and SAP_MessageType.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses Custom Headers with hardcoded values, but it could be enhanced including dynamic values from Payload.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The file metainfo.prop contains values for source, target, and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF (SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ) uses underscores. It should follow Java notation (e.g., com.example.iflow).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes parameters, such as Data Store Name, Poll Interval, Retry Interval, Lock Timeout, Maximum Retry Interval, Exponential Backoff and RoleName.
- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow implements error handling using error sub-processes and logging exceptions.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses Groovy scripts. A review is required for classes from packages com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow does not have more than 10 "callActivity" in the same "SequenceFlow".
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    A review is required to check for attachment creation using messageLogFactory in Groovy scripts.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process files.
- **Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with HTTPS Sender Adapter, and a parameter for RoleName is defined, a review is required to check if the iflow not is configured to allow Basic Auth and uses ESBMessaging.send role, either hardcoded in BPMN XML or in Configured values, that췂s considered insecure.
