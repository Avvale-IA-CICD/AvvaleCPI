**iFlowId:** SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion:** 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
-   **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow contains multiple "callActivity" elements with generic names such as "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Set Headers", "Custom Status", "Log Async Exception". While the names provide some context, more descriptive names would significantly improve readability and maintainability.

-   **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` for monitoring purposes.

-   **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses custom status codes and headers for monitoring the flow such as `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus`.

-   **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

-   **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`. This uses underscores and hyphens. It should follow Java naming conventions (e.g., `com.example.seda.model`).

-   **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow extensively uses externalized parameters denoted by `{{...}}` for data store name, retry intervals, expiration period, and alerting thresholds.

-   **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow implements error handling using Error Event Subprocesses within each step and the main router.

-   **Local Script Security** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow contains groovy scripts, it is necessary to check if the script is importing clases from these packages com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore

-   **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow does not seem to have any single "SequenceFlow" with more than 10 "callActivity" elements.

-   **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The script content was provided, it is necessary to check if the script uses the class `messageLogFactory`.

-   **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs.

-   **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to directly handle files.
