**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    - Several call activities use generic names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Set Headers", and "Custom Status". More descriptive names would improve readability.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The iFlow uses standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType`.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The iFlow uses custom status enrichers to add `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus`, enabling payload search and filtering based on processing status. The "Step" header, while potentially useful, would benefit from more descriptive naming.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    - The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`. It should follow Java notation (e.g., `com.example.seda.model`).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The iFlow externalizes parameters such as `RoleName`, `Maximum Retry Interval`, `Exponential Backoff`, `Data Store Name`, `Poll Interval`, `Retry Interval`, `Lock Timeout`, `Retention Threshold 4 Alerting`, `Expiration Period` and `MaxRetries`.
- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The iFlow implements error handling using error subprocesses in multiple integration processes (`Process_44`, `Process_40`, `Process_9050`, `Process_1`, `Process_36`) and logs exceptions using the "Log Async Exception" process.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The iFlow does not appear to use classes from the `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages in its Groovy scripts.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The iflow does not contain any "SequenceFlow" with more than 10 "callActivity" steps.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The iFlow does not appear to create attachments using `messageLogFactory` in Groovy scripts.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    - There is no evidence of IDoc processing in the provided iFlow definition.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    - There is no evidence of file processing in the provided iFlow definition.
- **Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    - The iFlow exposes an endpoint with `HTTPS Sender Adapter`. The `userRole` property for `MessageFlow_12079786` is parameterized as `{{RoleName}}`. Check if the Role allows Basic Auth, or if it uses the ESBMessaging.send role, as these are insecure configurations.
