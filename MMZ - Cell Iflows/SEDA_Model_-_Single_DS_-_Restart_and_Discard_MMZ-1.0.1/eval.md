**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow contains steps with generic names such as "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Set Headers", "Custom Status", "Log Async Exception". These should be renamed to reflect their specific function.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow is using standard headers like SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, and SAP_MessageType for monitoring.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The provided data doesn't show if any custom headers are used for enhancing payload search and filtering. It's recommended to add relevant custom headers for better monitoring.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The metainfo.prop file contains values for source, target, and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF is "SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ". It should follow Java notation (e.g., com.sap.example.iflow).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes important parameters like Data Store Name, MaxRetries, Expiration Period, and Retry Intervals.
- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow implements error handling using Error Event Subprocesses in each "Step" process and the SEDA Router. It also includes logic to log exceptions asynchronously.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses groovy scripts (script1.groovy and Log_Exception_Async.groovy). A manual security review is required to ensure no usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` classes.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iflow does not have more than 10 "callActivity" in the same "SequenceFlow".
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iflow contains "Log_Exception_Async.groovy" script, it is important to review this script and Groovy_Logging_Scripts Script Collection to validate that no attachments are created for succesful messages using messageLogFactory class.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    This iFlow doesn't appear to process IDoc messages.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    This iFlow doesn't appear to process files directly.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an HTTPS endpoint. It's using Role Based authentication, checking for `ESBMessaging.send` role. The userRole is externalized as a parameter `{{RoleName}}`. This could still be considered insecure and should be reviewed. Basic authentication is disabled.
