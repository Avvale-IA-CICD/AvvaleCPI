**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.0

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    Some call activities like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3" and "Custom Status" are present, which can be improved with more descriptive names.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    Standard Headers such as `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` are used.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    While standard headers are present, the use of custom headers for enhanced payload search and filtering isn't apparent in all steps. More custom headers for logging business-relevant data would improve monitoring.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The description field in `metainfo.prop` is empty. Populating the description, source, and target fields would improve the iflow's documentation.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`. It should follow Java notation (e.g., `com.example.seda.model`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow makes use of external parameters such as `SEDA_MAIN_QUEUE`, `Number of Concurrent Processes`, `Maximum Retry Interval`, `Retry Interval`, `Retention Threshold 4 Alerting` and `Expiration Period`

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    Error handling is implemented using Error Subprocesses in processes "Step 1","Step 2" and "Step 3", "SEDA Router" and "Dummy Start" logging exceptions using a "Log Async Exception" process call.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The code doesn't seem to be using any class from the packages `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No sequence flow uses more than 10 call activities.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The code doesn't seem to create any attachment for succesful messages

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    This iFlow doesn't seem to be related to IDoc processing.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    This iFlow doesn't seem to be related to file processing.
