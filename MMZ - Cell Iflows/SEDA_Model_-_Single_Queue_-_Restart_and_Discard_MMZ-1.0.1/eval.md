**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iflow contains generic step names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Next Step" and "Custom Status". More descriptive names should be used.

The iflow is using custom headers SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus.

The iflow is not using classes from packages com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore in any of the scripts.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
No SequenceFlow contains more than 10 call activities.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iflow does not seem to be creating attachments, but it's important to confirm that the scripts don't use `messageLogFactory` in a way that could lead to excessive resource consumption.
