**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow contains `callActivity` steps with generic names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Set Headers" and "Custom Status". This makes it harder to understand the flow's purpose at a glance.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` for monitoring.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow leverages Custom Headers for custom status updates, such as `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus`.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`. It uses underscores and hyphens instead of java notation with dots (e.g., `com.example.seda.flow`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow utilizes externalized parameters (e.g., `{{SEDA_MAIN_QUEUE}}`, `{{Retention Threshold 4 Alerting}}`, `{{Expiration Period}}`, `{{Number of Concurrent Processes}}`, `{{Maximum Retry Interval}}`, `{{Retry Interval}}`, `{{MaxRetries}}`) for configuration, improving maintainability.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow includes error handling using error sub-processes and logging.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow does not appear to use classes from `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` in the provided scripts.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow doesn't seem to have more than 10 `callActivity` elements in a single `SequenceFlow`.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow does not appear to be creating attachments using `messageLogFactory` during groovy scripting.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow doesn't seem to be processing IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow doesn't seem to be processing files.

- **Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with an HTTPS Sender Adapter (`Participant_12079805`). It uses `ESBMessaging.send` role and has `enableBasicAuthentication` set to `false`, which is better than enabling it. A deeper review of the authentication and authorization configuration is advised.
