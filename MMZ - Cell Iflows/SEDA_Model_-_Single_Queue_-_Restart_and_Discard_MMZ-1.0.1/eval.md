**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow contains several `callActivity` elements with generic names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Custom Status", "Log Async Exception" and "Set Headers". While these names provide some context, more descriptive names would improve readability and maintainability.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow utilizes standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` for monitoring purposes in the "Dummy Start" and "SEDA Router" processes.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow utilizes custom headers like `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus` for monitoring in several processes, including exception subprocesses.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`, indicating that the developer has populated the iFlow metadata.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`. This uses underscores and hyphens. It should follow Java notation (e.g., `com.sap.example.iflow`).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes important parameters like queue names (`SEDA_MAIN_QUEUE`), retry intervals (`Retry Interval`, `Maximum Retry Interval`), and thresholds (`Retention Threshold 4 Alerting`, `Expiration Period`, `MaxRetries`) via configurable parameters.
- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow incorporates error handling via exception subprocesses in multiple processes ("Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "SEDA Router", "Dummy Start"), including logging exceptions and setting custom statuses.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The provided code does not use any classes from the `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No single "SequenceFlow" contains more than 10 "callActivity" elements.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The provided code does not create attachments for successful messages using the `messageLogFactory` class in any Groovy scripts.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to handle IDocs, so this rule is not applicable.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to handle files directly, so this rule is not applicable.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with the HTTPS Sender Adapter. It is configured to allow Role Based authentication using userRole `ESBMessaging.send`. There are no indication that Basic Authentication is used. Developer should verify the Basic Authentication flag not is enabled.
