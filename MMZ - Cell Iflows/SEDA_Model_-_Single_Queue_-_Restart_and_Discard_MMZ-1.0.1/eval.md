**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iflow contains generic call activity names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Custom Status", "Set Headers". These names are not descriptive enough.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iflow utilizes standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, `SAP_MessageType`, and `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus` for monitoring.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    While the iflow uses standard headers, it's unclear if custom headers are used to enhance payload search and filtering beyond the standard headers.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains `source`, `target`, and `description`.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The Bundle-SymbolicName `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ` uses hyphens and underscores.  It should follow Java package naming conventions (e.g., `com.example.seda.model`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iflow externalizes important parameters like queue names, retry intervals, and expiration periods.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iflow implements error handling with error sub-processes in each integration process, logging exceptions and setting custom statuses.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iflow does not use classes from packages `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No sequence flow contains more than 10 call activities.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    It is necessary to analyze the local scripts content to understand if attachments are being created for succesful messages, making use of class messageLogFactory during groovy scripting.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow does not appear to process IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow does not appear to process files directly through the adapters.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes endpoints with HTTPS Sender Adapter and uses ESBMessaging.send role. This requires a check to ensure that the iflow not is configured to allow Basic Auth.
