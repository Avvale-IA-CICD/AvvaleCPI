**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The iFlow contains multiple "callActivity" elements with generic names like "Set Headers" and "Custom Status". These should be named more descriptively to reflect their specific function within the iFlow.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow utilizes standard headers such as `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` in multiple steps, indicating a focus on standard monitoring practices.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow utilizes custom headers, such as `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus`, suggesting an effort to enhance payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` uses underscores and hyphens (`SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`) instead of the recommended Java notation (dots).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow externalizes important parameters, such as queue names and retry intervals, as evidenced by the use of `{{...}}` in various properties, like `QueueName_outbound` and `RetryInterval`.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow implements error handling by including error sub-processes and logging exceptions using `Log Async Exception` call activities, as well as setting custom status. Groovy script `script1.groovy` is being used to throw and exception.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow does not appear to use classes from `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow does not exceed 10 "callActivity" elements within any single "SequenceFlow."

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    There is an usage of `Groovy_Logging_Scripts` script bundle, review if class `messageLogFactory` is being used to create attachments for successful messages. This can lead to resource consumption issues.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\\n
    The iFlow does not appear to involve IDoc processing.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\\n
    The iFlow does not appear to involve file processing.
