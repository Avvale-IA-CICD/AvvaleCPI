**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
-   **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow contains multiple `callActivity` elements with generic names such as "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Set Headers", "Custom Status" and "Log Async Exception". These should be renamed to more descriptive names to improve readability and understanding.

-   **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses standard headers such as `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` for monitoring purposes, improving tracking and correlation across systems.

-   **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses custom headers for monitoring that enhance payload search and filtering, improving tracking and correlation across systems. The custom headers are mostly related to monitoring the different steps of the iFlow.

-   **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description` metadata, providing basic information about the iFlow's purpose and scope.

-   **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`. This should follow Java package naming conventions (e.g., `com.example.seda.model`) using dots instead of underscores or hyphens.

-   **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes parameters such as queue names, retry intervals, and other configuration values, making the iFlow more flexible and easier to manage across different environments.

-   **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow implements error handling using error subprocesses with error start and end events. It also includes logging of exceptions and setting custom statuses for error conditions.

-   **Local Script Security** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses Groovy scripts. The analysis should determine if the scripts utilize classes from the `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages. If these classes are used, the code represents a potential security risk.

-   **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iflow structure is readable and does not contain more than 10 "callActivity" in the same "SequenceFlow".

-   **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses Groovy scripting for logging exceptions, it would be necesary to manually check if the "messageLogFactory" is used during groovy scripting to create attachments for succesful messages, only failed messages should be logged, normally in exception process.

-   **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs, so this rule is not applicable.

-   **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process files directly, so this rule is not applicable.

-   **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint using HTTPS Sender Adapter and allows the `ESBMessaging.send` role, which might be insecure. Check if Basic Auth is enabled and/or if the role assignment is hardcoded in BPMN XML or configured values. These settings represent potential security risks.
