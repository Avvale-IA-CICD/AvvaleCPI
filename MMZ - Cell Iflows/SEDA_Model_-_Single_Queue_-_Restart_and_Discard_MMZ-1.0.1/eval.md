**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The iFlow contains `callActivity` elements with generic names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Custom Status", which doesn't provide enough context about their functionality. Also exist one "Next Step" name in service tasks.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow uses standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` for monitoring in the "Dummy Start" and "SEDA Router" processes.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow uses custom headers such as `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus` to enhance payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The `metainfo.prop` file is populated with `source`, `target`, and `description` values.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_MMZ`. It should follow Java naming conventions (e.g., `com.example.seda.model`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow externalizes parameters like `SEDA_MAIN_QUEUE`, `Retry Interval`, `MaxRetries`, etc., via Config Parameters.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow includes error handling using Error Subprocesses in multiple processes (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, SEDA Router and Dummy Start). It also logs exceptions using `Log Async Exception` script.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The provided code snippets for the groovy scripts do not include any classes from the specified securestore or keystore packages (`com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`).

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
  There are no sequence flows with more than 10 `callActivity` elements.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The iFlow does not appear to be creating attachments for successful messages. The messageLogFactory is not in use in the local scripts.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
  The iFlow does not explicitly handle IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
  The iFlow does not explicitly handle files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The iFlow exposes an HTTPS endpoint using the HTTPS sender adapter. It is configured to use `RoleBased` authentication and `ESBMessaging.send` role, which might be considered insecure and requires further investigation to ensure proper authorization and authentication mechanisms are in place. Also, Basic Authentication is disabled, which is good.
