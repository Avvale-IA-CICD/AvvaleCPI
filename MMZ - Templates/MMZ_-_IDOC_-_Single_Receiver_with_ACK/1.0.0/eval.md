**iFlowId**: MMZ_-_IDOC_-_Single_Receiver_with_ACK - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.0

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iflow contains `callActivity` steps with generic names such as "Parse Error", "Set Custom Status", "Init Message", "Request Logic Process". These should be renamed to better reflect their function.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iflow uses standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, `SAP_MessageType` in the "Init Message" step of "Delivery Process".

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iflow uses custom headers like `IDocIn`, `SNDPRN` (csIdocIn script), `IDocOut` (csIdocOut script).

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF uses hyphens and underscores: `MMZ_-_IDOC_-_Single_Receiver_with_ACK`. This should follow Java naming conventions using dots (e.g., com.example.idoc.receiver).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iflow externalizes parameters such as `ReceiverAddress`, `ACK_DATASTORE_NAME`, `SS4_CREDENTIAL`, `endpointPath`, `SENDER_ROLE`, `LOCATION_ID`, and `IDOC_ADDRESS_SAP`.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iflow implements error handling using Error Event Subprocesses in both the "Request Logic" and "Delivery Process" processes.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The local scripts don't use the classes `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iflow doesn't appear to have any "SequenceFlows" with more than 10 "callActivity" elements.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The `csIdocIn` and `csIdocOut` scripts use `messageLogFactory`, meaning that attachments are created for both succesful and failed messages.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow logging DOCNUM as Custom Headers (`IDocIn` and `IDocOut` custom search properties).

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow doesn't contain any File adapter.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow exposes an IDoc endpoint (`Participant_1`) with RoleBased authentication, but it requires a check if the iflow allows Basic Auth and uses ESBMessaging.send role.
