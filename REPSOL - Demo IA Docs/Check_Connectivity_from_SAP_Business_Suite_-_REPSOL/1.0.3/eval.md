**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *The iflow step "CallActivity_1" has a descriptive name: "Mapping".*

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    *The iFlow doesn't explicitly set or use standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.).*

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    *The iFlow doesn't explicitly set or use custom headers for monitoring.*

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *The metainfo.prop file contains source, target, and description.*

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    *The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF (Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL) uses underscores and hyphens. It should follow java class style notation using dots.*

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *Several parameters like addresses, wsdl URLs, authentication flags, host, and port are externalized as configurable parameters.*

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    *The iFlow doesn't appear to have explicit error handling mechanisms defined.*

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *No local scripts are used, so there are no security concerns related to secure store or keystore APIs in local scripts.*

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *The iFlow has only one "callActivity" in the main sequence flow.*

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    *The iFlow doesn't seem to create attachments using messageLogFactory in groovy scripts.*

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    *The iFlow doesn't appear to be processing IDocs.*

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    *The iFlow doesn't appear to be processing files.*

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    *The iFlow exposes an endpoint with a SOAP Sender Adapter over HTTP. The `ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8` parameter is set to "true". This could represent a security vulnerability and further checks are required.*
