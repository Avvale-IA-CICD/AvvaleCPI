**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (The iFlow step "CallActivity_1" is named "Mapping", so this best practice is followed.)

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (The iflow does not explicitly set any Standard Headers for monitoring, so a check is required to confirm if they췂re being used in other way, for example, inside a mapping or script)

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (The iflow does not explicitly set any Custom Headers for monitoring, so a check is required to confirm if they췂re being used in other way, for example, inside a mapping or script)

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (The metainfo.prop file contains source, target, and description metadata.)

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF is "Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL". It uses underscores and hyphens instead of the recommended dot notation, so a check is required.)

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (The iflow externalizes several parameters like addresses, wsdl URLs, authentication flags, host, port, and credential names.)

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (There are no explicit error handling steps defined in the iflow, so a check is required.)

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (No local scripts were provided for analysis, so there췂s no presence of the classes com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore.)

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (The iflow only has one "callActivity", so the number of steps does not represent a readability issue)

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (Without local scripts for analysis we cannot determine the creation of attachments using messageLogFactory)

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    (The iflow does not appear to process IDocs.)

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    (The iflow does not appear to process files.)

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   (The ERP Participant uses a SOAP sender adapter with HTTP. The `ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8` parameter is externalized and set to `true`. While the value is parameterized, enabling Basic Authentication directly is a security concern. Need to confirm if ESBMessaging.send role is being used as well).
