**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (The iFlow only uses a "Mapping" step, which is properly named.)
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (The provided XML does not show explicit usage of standard monitoring headers.)
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (The provided XML does not show explicit usage of custom monitoring headers.)
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (The metainfo.prop file contains source, target and description.)
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF uses underscores and hyphens. Valid example: com.sap.check.cod.connectivity. The current value is Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL)
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (The iflow externalizes parameters such as URLs, authentication flags, host, port, and credential name.)
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (There is no explicit error handling implemented.)
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (No local scripts are used, so this is not applicable.)
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (There are no more than 10 "callActivity" in the same "SequenceFlow".)
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    (Groovy scripting is not used, so no attachments are being created.)
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    (The iflow does not seem to handle IDoc messages)
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    (The iflow does not seem to handle file messages)
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    (The iflow exposes endpoints with SOAP Sender Adapter. Even though "ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8" is configurable, it is set to "true".
