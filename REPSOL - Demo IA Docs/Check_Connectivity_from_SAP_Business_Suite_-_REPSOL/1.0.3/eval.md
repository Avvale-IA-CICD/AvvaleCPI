**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.3

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
   No generic step names found (e.g., Sender, Receiver, Content Modifier). The only `callActivity` is named "Mapping".

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow definition does not explicitly configure the use of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, SAP_ApplicationID...).

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow definition doesn't show any explicit usage of custom headers for monitoring.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The `metainfo.prop` file includes values for `source`, `target`, and `description`.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. It uses underscores and hyphens, violating Java naming conventions.  It should use dots instead, e.g., `com.repsol.connectivity.check`.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iFlow externalizes several parameters, including addresses, WSDL URLs, authentication flags, and credential names using placeholders.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow definition does not explicitly show any error handling mechanisms implemented.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
   No usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages is found in the provided local scripts content (which is empty).

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iFlow contains only one `callActivity` within the main sequence flow, so it does not violate the threshold of more than 10 call activities in the same sequence flow.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
   There's no evidence of attachment creation via `messageLogFactory` in the (empty) local scripts.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
   The iFlow does not appear to be processing IDocs based on the adapter types used (SOAP).

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
   The iFlow does not appear to be processing files directly based on the adapter types used (SOAP).

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The ERP Sender Adapter uses SOAP over HTTP. The property `ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8` is set to `true`. This means that the flow allows basic authentication, which is generally considered insecure and a potential risk. The iFlow should use certificate based authentication or other secure methods.
