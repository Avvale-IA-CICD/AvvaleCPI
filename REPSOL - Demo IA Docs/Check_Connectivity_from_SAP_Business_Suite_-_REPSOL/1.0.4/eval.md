**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The call activity "CallActivity_1" is named "Mapping", which is not a standard name.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    - The iFlow does not explicitly set any standard headers for monitoring purposes. There's no evidence of SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc. being used.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    - The iFlow does not explicitly set any custom headers for monitoring purposes, to enhance payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    - The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`.  This uses underscores and hyphens, which is not the recommended java notation. It should follow `com.sap.example.iflow.connectivity` format.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - The iFlow externalizes several parameters like URLs, authentication settings, and host information using placeholders like `{{ERP_address_1}}`, `{{Host}}`, `{{Port}}`, and `{{ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8}}`.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    - There is no explicit error handling defined within the provided BPMN XML. There are no exception subprocesses or explicit try-catch constructs.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - There are no local scripts, so no check is necessary for usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` classes.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - There is only one `callActivity` in the sequence flow, which is less than the threshold of 10.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    - There are no local scripts, so no attachments can be created using class messageLogFactory.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    - The iFlow doesn't seem to involve IDocs based on the provided XML.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    - The iFlow doesn't seem to process files directly based on the provided XML.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    - The iFlow exposes a SOAP endpoint from ERP (Sender). The `ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8` parameter is externalized, which suggests it could be enabled. The iflow requires a check to verify that the iflow is not configured to allow Basic Auth and uses ESBMessaging.send role, either hardcoded in BPMN XML or in Configured values, that췂s considered insecure.
