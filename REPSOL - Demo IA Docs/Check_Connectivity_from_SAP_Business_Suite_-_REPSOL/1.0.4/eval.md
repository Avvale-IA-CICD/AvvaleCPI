**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow uses "Mapping" as name for the callActivity, which is better than default names.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow definition doesn't explicitly show usage of standard monitoring headers. A deeper inspection of the mapping and any scripts would be needed to confirm their usage.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow definition doesn't explicitly show usage of custom monitoring headers. A deeper inspection of the mapping and any scripts would be needed to confirm their usage.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. This uses underscores and hyphens instead of the recommended java package naming convention (e.g., `com.sap.check.cod.connectivity`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow externalizes parameters like addresses, WSDL URLs, authentication flags, and credentials.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow definition doesn't explicitly show any kind of Error Handling. A deeper inspection is required

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
No local scripts are provided, so there's no risk of insecure API usage in local scripts.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow only has one `callActivity` in the main sequence flow.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
No local scripts are provided so there is no usage of messageLogFactory

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow doesn't appear to be dealing with IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow doesn't appear to be processing files directly.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow exposes an endpoint using SOAP Sender Adapter. The `ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8` parameter is set to "true" , which is considered insecure if not handled with specific roles other than ESBMessaging.send.
