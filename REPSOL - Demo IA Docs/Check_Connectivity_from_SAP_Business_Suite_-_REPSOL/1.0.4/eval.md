**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    * No generic names like Sender, Receiver, Content Modifier, or Router are used for the call activity (Mapping).

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    * The iFlow does not explicitly show usage of standard monitoring headers like SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc. Need to check the mapping and scripts (if any) to confirm their usage.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    * The iFlow does not explicitly show usage of custom monitoring headers. Need to check the mapping and scripts (if any) to confirm their usage.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    * The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    * The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. This does not follow the recommended Java notation (using dots and avoiding underscores/hyphens). Should be refactored.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    * Important parameters like URLs, authentication settings (enableBasicAuthentication), and credential names are externalized as configurable parameters.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    * The provided BPMN XML does not explicitly show error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception subprocesses, error events). Needs further investigation to confirm if error handling is implemented.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    * The iFlow does not contain local scripts. No security risk identified for insecure classes.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    * There is only one call activity in the sequence flow.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    * No local scripts, so no risk for creating attachments for successful messages.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    * The iFlow is a SOAP to SOAP scenario, not involving IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    * The iFlow is a SOAP to SOAP scenario, not involving file processing.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    * The iFlow exposes a SOAP endpoint. The ERP Sender Adapter has property ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8=true, meaning that Basic Auth is enabled. This is considered insecure, so OAuth or Certificates usage should be prefered. Also check for role ESBMessaging.send assignment in case Basic Auth scenario is mandatory
