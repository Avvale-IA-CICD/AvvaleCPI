**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iflow contains a `callActivity` named "Mapping". While not a standard name like Sender or Receiver, it is generic. More descriptive names are recommended.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iflow XML does not explicitly define any standard headers being set for monitoring purposes.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iflow XML does not explicitly define any custom headers being set for monitoring purposes.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The metainfo.prop file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF uses underscores and hyphens: `Check_Connectivity_from_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. Java notation requires dots.
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iflow externalizes several parameters, including URLs, authentication settings, and host/port configurations.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iflow XML does not appear to have any explicit error handling mechanisms implemented.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
   No local scripts are provided and therefore no security concern in local script.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iflow only contains one call activity inside the Integration Process.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
   There is no evidence of attachment creation using messageLogFactory in Groovy scripts.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
   The iFlow does not appear to involve IDoc processing.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
   The iFlow does not appear to involve file processing.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow exposes an endpoint with SOAP Sender Adapter, and `ERP_enableBasicAuthentication_8` parameter is set to `true`, so Basic Auth is enabled and it is required to check if ESBMessaging.send role is being used, either hardcoded in BPMN XML or in Configured values.
