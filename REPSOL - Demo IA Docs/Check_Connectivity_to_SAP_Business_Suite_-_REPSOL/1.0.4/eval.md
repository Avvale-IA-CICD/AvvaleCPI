**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
   All call activities are properly named.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow does not appear to be explicitly using standard headers for monitoring. Review and implement standard headers to improve monitoring capabilities.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow does not appear to be using custom headers.  Custom headers should be added to improve payload search and filtering capabilities.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The metainfo.prop file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The Bundle-SymbolicName in the MANIFEST.MF file (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL) uses underscores and hyphens. It should follow Java notation (e.g., com.sap.check.cod.connectivity).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   Important parameters like URLs, authentication details (username, password, hostname, client) and location id are externalized in configuration parameters.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   There is no explicit error handling implemented in the iFlow steps.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
   No usage of com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore packages found in local scripts.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iFlow uses only one "callActivity" within the sequence flow.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
   There is no logging using messageLogFactory.createAttachment() found within Groovy Scripts.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
   The iFlow does not appear to be handling IDoc messages.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
   The iFlow does not appear to be handling file-based messages.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow uses a SOAP sender adapter, and `COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3` is set to `true`. The iFlow allows Basic Auth which is considered insecure, and the usage of `ESBMessaging.send` role should be checked, either hardcoded in BPMN XML or in configured values.
