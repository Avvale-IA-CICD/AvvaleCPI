iFlowId: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - iFlowVersion:1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
 The iFlow contains a call activity named "Mapping". While this isn't a default name, it's generic. Consider naming it more specifically based on the mapping's purpose.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
 The provided XML doesn't explicitly show the usage of standard monitoring headers. Review and implement relevant standard headers for improved monitoring.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
 The provided XML doesn't explicitly show the usage of custom monitoring headers. Implement custom headers to enhance payload search and filtering capabilities for effective monitoring.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
 The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
 The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` uses underscores and hyphens: `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. It should follow Java naming conventions (e.g., `com.repsol.connectivity.check`).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
 The iFlow leverages externalized parameters (using `{{...}}`) for various configurations like URLs, authentication details, and location IDs.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
 The provided XML doesn't explicitly show error handling within the iFlow steps. Implement error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception subprocesses) to handle potential failures gracefully.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
 No local scripts are present, so there are no apparent security risks related to `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
 The iFlow only has one call activity.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
  The provided iflow doesn't seem to use messageLogFactory to create attachments for successful messages.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
  The iFlow doesn't seem to be processing IDocs.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
  The iFlow doesn't seem to be processing files.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
 The iFlow exposes an endpoint using SOAP Sender Adapter, and `COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3` is set to `true`.  Also, `ERP_authentication_5` is set to `Basic`. Enabling basic authentication directly without proper security measures is considered insecure and requires careful review. Using parameters is a good practice, but the iflow needs to be reviewed to avoid hardcoded ESBMessaging.send role.
