**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.4

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No generic "callActivity" names (like Sender, Receiver, etc.) are used. The "callActivity" is named "Mapping".
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The provided XML doesn't explicitly show usage of Standard Headers for monitoring. This should be checked.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The provided XML doesn't explicitly show usage of Custom Headers for monitoring. This should be checked.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. It should follow Java notation (e.g., `com.sap.check.cod.connectivity`) using dots instead of underscores or hyphens.
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses externalized parameters (e.g., `{{COD_address_2}}`, `{{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}`, `{{artifactname}}`), which are configured in the configuration parameters.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The provided XML doesn't explicitly show any error handling mechanisms. This should be checked.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No local scripts are present, so there's no risk of using insecure classes.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    Only one "callActivity" step is used.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There are no local scripts so we don췂t need to validate attachments in groovy scripts.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    This iFlow does not seem to be processing IDocs.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    This iFlow does not seem to be processing files.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes endpoints with SOAP Sender Adapter. The configuration "COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3" is set to true which is considered insecure and should be avoided if possible, in those cases user certificates, OAuth or SAML are prefered. It's necessary to check the iflow configuration for Basic Auth and `ESBMessaging.send` role.
