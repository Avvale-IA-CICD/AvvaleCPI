**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
All callActivity steps have a specific name, no standard names found.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow does not appear to explicitly set or utilize standard monitoring headers.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow does not appear to explicitly set or utilize custom monitoring headers to enhance payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL) uses underscores and hyphens. It should use java notation (dots) instead, such as com.sap.check.cod.connectivity.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow extensively uses externalized parameters (e.g., URLs, authentication details, locationId) in the "Config Parameters".

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow does not appear to have explicit error handling mechanisms implemented within its steps.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
No local scripts were found, so there is no usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
The iFlow contains only one `callActivity` in the main sequence flow, thus not representing a readability issue.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
No evidence of creating attachments for successful messages using `messageLogFactory` in Groovy scripts.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow does not seem to be dealing with IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
The iFlow does not seem to be dealing with Files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
The iFlow exposes endpoints with SOAP Sender Adapter and is configured to allow Basic Auth (`COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3=true`). This requires manual verification to ensure that it췂s not using ESBMessaging.send role hardcoded in BPMN XML or in Configured values.
