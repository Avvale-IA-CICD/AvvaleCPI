**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

-

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
        - The iflow steps seem to be adequately named ("Mapping"). There are no default names like "Content Modifier" etc.
    - **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        - The iFlow XML and related files do not show explicit usage of Standard Headers for monitoring.
    - **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        - The iFlow XML and related files do not show explicit usage of Custom Headers for monitoring.
    - **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
        - The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`.
    - **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        - The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. This uses underscores and hyphens, which is not in the recommended Java notation (e.g., `com.sap.check.cod.connectivity`).
    - **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
        -  The iFlow uses externalized parameters (e.g., `{{COD_address_2}}`, `{{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}`, `{{artifactname}}`) for connection details, authentication, and addresses.
    - **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        - The iFlow XML does not explicitly show any error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception subprocesses, error events).
    - **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
        - No local scripts content was provided to search classes from these packages com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore.
    - **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
        - There is only one `callActivity` within the main sequence flow. The rule of "more than 10 callActivity in the same SequenceFlow" is not met.
    - **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
        - The provided data doesn't show any evidence of creating attachments using `messageLogFactory` in Groovy scripts.
    - **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
        - The iFlow doesn't seem to explicitly process IDocs based on the provided XML. Therefore, the IDoc-specific rule doesn't directly apply.
    - **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
        - The iFlow doesn't seem to explicitly process Files based on the provided XML. Therefore, the File-specific rule doesn't directly apply.
    - **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游릭 Ok\
        - The iFlow uses a SOAP Sender Adapter but it's configured to expose endpoints with Basic Authentication enabled (`COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3=true`). According to the config parameters, the credentials are not hardcoded in BPMN XML but referenced by a configuration `credentialName` (artifactname=EntryUserPassSAP). The value is externalized, so it is not considered an insecure scenario
