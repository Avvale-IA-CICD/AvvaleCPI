**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No generic callActivity names found. The "CallActivity_1" is named "Mapping" which is acceptable.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not explicitly set standard headers for monitoring. Needs manual review.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not explicitly set custom headers for monitoring. Needs manual review.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    Metadata (source, target, description) is present in the `metainfo.prop` file.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL) does not follow Java naming conventions (using underscores instead of dots).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes several parameters such as URLs, authentication data (ERP_authentication_5), and location-id using placeholders/variables.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    There is no explicit error handling defined in the provided BPMN XML. A review of the mapping (COD_ERP_CheckEnd2EndConnectivity.opmap) and other components is needed to ensure proper error handling.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages found in the provided data.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow contains only one "callActivity", so it does not violate the readibility rule of max 10 "callActivity" in the same "SequenceFlow".
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No evidence of attachment creation using `messageLogFactory` found.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow doesn't appear to process IDocs.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow doesn't appear to process Files.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with a SOAP Sender Adapter, with Basic Authentication enabled (COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3=true). A review of the security configurations (ESBMessaging.send role) is required.
