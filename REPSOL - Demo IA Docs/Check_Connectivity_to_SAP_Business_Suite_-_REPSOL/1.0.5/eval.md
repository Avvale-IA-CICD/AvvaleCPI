**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    All call activities have meaningful names.  No default names like "Content Modifier" or "Router" are used.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML does not explicitly define any standard headers being set for monitoring purposes.  This requires a manual check to confirm if standard headers are being used within scripts or other components.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML does not explicitly define any custom headers being set for monitoring.  Requires manual check to confirm if custom headers are being used within scripts or other components to enhance payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `MANIFEST.MF` file's `Bundle-SymbolicName` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. This should follow java class notation with dots instead of underscores or hyphens. For example: com.sap.check.cod.connectivity.  This needs to be corrected.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    Multiple parameters, including authentication details, URLs, and the location ID are externalized as configuration parameters.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow XML doesn't show explicit error handling mechanisms. Requires manual investigation to determine if any error handling is implemented within mapping or other components.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` classes is detected in the provided "Local Scripts Content."

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There is only one `callActivity` within the main sequence flow, so the number is not exceeding 10.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No usage of `messageLogFactory` for creating attachments is detected in the provided "Local Scripts Content".

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint through a SOAP sender adapter using `Participant_1`. The `COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3` parameter is set to `true`. The BPMN does not explicitly define if the `ESBMessaging.send` role is used. This requires manually checking the security configuration to ensure it doesn't rely on basic authentication with `ESBMessaging.send`.
