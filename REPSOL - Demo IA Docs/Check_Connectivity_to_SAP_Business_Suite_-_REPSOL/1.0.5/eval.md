**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No generic call activity names found (Sender, Receiver, Content Modifier, etc.). Only a "Mapping" step is present.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow doesn't explicitly define or manipulate any standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, SAP_ApplicationID) in the provided BPMN XML. This requires manual check to confirm if they are being used within the Mapping or any other process.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow doesn't explicitly define or manipulate any custom headers in the provided BPMN XML. This requires manual check to confirm if they are being used within the Mapping or any other process.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file includes `description`, `source`, and `target` metadata.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `MANIFEST.MF` file's `Bundle-SymbolicName` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. This does not follow the recommended Java package naming convention (e.g., `com.sap.check.cod.connectivity`). It uses underscores and hyphens which are discouraged.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow extensively externalizes parameters like addresses, authentication details, and client information using variables (e.g., `{{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}`, `{{artifactname}}`, `{{Client}}`).

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The BPMN XML does not explicitly show any error handling mechanisms (e.g., error sub-processes, exception handling in scripts). This requires manual check if it is implemented.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages is found in the provided "Local Scripts Content" section, which is empty.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow has only one `callActivity` in the main sequence flow, which is less than 10.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There are no local scripts, so there's no possibility of using `messageLogFactory` to create attachments.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to handle IDocs based on the provided BPMN XML.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to handle files directly based on the provided BPMN XML.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with SOAP Sender Adapter. `COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3` parameter is set to `true`. Also the ESBMessaging.send role usage needs to be verified in the BPMN XML or Configured values, which requires further checking and is considered insecure.
