**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No standard callActivity names found. Only "Mapping" is used.
- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    No explicit use of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.) is apparent in the provided XML.
- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    No custom headers for monitoring are explicitly set in the provided XML.
- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The metainfo.prop file contains values for source, target, and description.
- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The Bundle-SymbolicName in MANIFEST.MF (Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL) uses underscores and hyphens.  It should use java notation (dots).
- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow extensively uses externalized parameters (e.g., {{COD_address_2}}, {{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}, {{artifactname}}), which is good practice.
- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    No explicit error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception subprocesses, error events) are visible in the provided XML.
- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No usage of `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` packages detected in the provided data.
- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There is only one call activity between start and end events.
- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No use of `messageLogFactory` for attachments during groovy scripting found.
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow does not appear to be processing IDocs.
- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow does not appear to be processing files directly.
- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The COD Sender Adapter uses SOAP and exposes endpoints, and COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3 is set to "true", which is insecure. Also, authentication is configured with variables that could allow Basic Auth. Need to verify the iFlow does not use ESBMessaging.send role hardcoded or in configuration.
