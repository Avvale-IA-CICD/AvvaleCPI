**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No "callActivity" steps with standard names like Sender, Receiver, Content Modifier, etc. were found. The step "CallActivity_1" is named "Mapping".

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not explicitly show the usage of standard monitoring headers (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, SAP_MessageType, SAP_ApplicationID). It is possible they are used in a mapping or script not directly visible in the BPMN, but this should be verified.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not explicitly show the usage of custom monitoring headers. It's possible these are being set within the mapping, but that requires further investigation.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. This does not follow Java notation (using dots instead of underscores/hyphens). Should be com.sap.check.cod.connectivity or similar.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes important parameters like addresses, authentication credentials, and location ID using configurable properties.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The BPMN XML does not show any explicit error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception subprocesses, error events).  It's possible error handling is implemented within the mapping, but that needs to be confirmed. The `returnExceptionToSender` is set to `false` but without error process this might not be enough.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No local scripts were provided, so no security concerns are present in that area.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There is only one "callActivity" within the main sequence flow.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There is no evidence of attachment creation using `messageLogFactory` in Groovy scripts.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to be processing IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to be processing files directly.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses a SOAP sender adapter.  The `COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3` parameter is set to `true`. This means basic authentication could be enabled. Moreover, it should be checked if  ESBMessaging.send role is configured either hardcoded in BPMN XML or in Configured values. Using Basic Auth and ESBMessaging.send is considered insecure.
