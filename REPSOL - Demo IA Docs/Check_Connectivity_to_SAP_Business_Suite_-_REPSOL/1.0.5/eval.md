- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
  The iFlow has an inbound SOAP endpoint exposed through `Participant_1` (COD) and has `COD_enableBasicAuthentication_3` set to `true` which can represent a security issue if not correctly secured with roles and policies to prevent basic authentication. Also, the `ERP` endpoint is using basic authentication with the parameter `ERP_authentication_5=Basic`. This is considered insecure and must be secured.
