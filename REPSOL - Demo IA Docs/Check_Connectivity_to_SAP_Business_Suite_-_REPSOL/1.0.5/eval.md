**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
    There is one "callActivity" step called "Mapping", which is not a default name.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not appear to explicitly set or use standard headers for monitoring. Further analysis would be required to determine if they are implicitly used.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not appear to explicitly set or use custom headers for monitoring. Further analysis would be required to determine if they are implicitly used.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`. This should be using dots instead of underscores or hyphens and using java class style notation, like `com.sap.check.cod.connectivity`.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes parameters like URLs, authentication data, and client information.

- **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow does not appear to have explicit error handling within the process steps. Need to add Try-Catch Block scope to handle exceptions.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No local scripts are present. No classes from `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` are used.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow contains only one "callActivity" in the main sequence flow, which is less than the threshold of 10.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No local scripts are present. Therefore, the iflow is not creating attachments in groovy scripting.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with a SOAP Sender Adapter (Participant COD) and enableBasicAuthentication is set to true, and the authentication is set to Basic on the ERP side. It is important to check the authorization role used by the iflow, since it must be using something more secure than ESBMessaging.send.
