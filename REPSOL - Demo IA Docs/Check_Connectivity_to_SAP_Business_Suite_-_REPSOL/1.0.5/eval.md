**iFlowId**: Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.5

-

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\
        All call activities have meaningful names (e.g., Mapping).
    - **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        The iFlow does not explicitly define the use of Standard Headers for monitoring (SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, etc.). This should be checked and implemented if needed.
    - **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        The iFlow does not explicitly define the use of Custom Headers for monitoring. This should be checked and implemented if needed to enhance payload search and filtering.
    - **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
        The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for `source`, `target`, and `description`.
    - **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` (`Check_Connectivity_to_SAP_Business_Suite_-_REPSOL`) does not follow the recommended Java package naming convention (using dots instead of underscores/hyphens).
    - **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
        The iFlow uses externalized parameters (e.g., URLs, authentication data) using placeholders like `{{COD_address_2}}`, `{{artifactname}}`, and `{{Protocol-Hostname-Port}}`.
    - **Error Handling** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        The iFlow does not explicitly define any error handling mechanisms. Check if error handling is present in Mapping, even if it is not visible in BPMN diagram.
    - **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
        No local scripts were found in the IFLOW, and the IFLOW does not import potentially insecure packages (`com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore`).
    - **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
        The iFlow uses a single call activity in the main flow.
    - **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
        The iFlow does not use messageLogFactory to create attachments for successful messages.
    - **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
        The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs, so this rule does not apply.
    - **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
        The iFlow does not appear to process files, so this rule does not apply.
    - **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
        The iFlow exposes endpoints with SOAP Sender Adapter and allows Basic Auth. Review if the iflow is configured to allow Basic Auth and uses ESBMessaging.send role, either hardcoded in BPMN XML or in Configured values, that췂s considered insecure.
