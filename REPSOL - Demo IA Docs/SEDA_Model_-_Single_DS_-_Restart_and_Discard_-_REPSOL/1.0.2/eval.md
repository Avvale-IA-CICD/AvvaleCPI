**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.2

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow contains `callActivity` elements with default names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Set Headers", "Custom Status", "Log Async Exception", "Log Discarded Message", "Prepare Step 2", "Discaded" which should be more descriptive.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses standard headers such as `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` for monitoring.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow doesn't seem to extensively use custom headers for monitoring to enhance payload search and filtering beyond standard headers. While it sets `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus`, more specific custom headers could be beneficial.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in the `MANIFEST.MF` file is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_DS_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_REPS OL`. This should follow Java notation (e.g., `com.example.iflow`). It includes hyphens and underscores instead of dots.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes several parameters, including `MaxRetries`, `Data Store Name`, `RoleName`, `Expiration Period`, `Lock Timeout`, `Maximum Retry Interval`, and `Poll Interval`.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow includes error sub-processes for handling exceptions in multiple steps.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iflow is using a groovy script named "script1.groovy" which throws an exception. No usage of classes from `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` are present in the groovy script or in the iflow steps.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow does not appear to have more than 10 `callActivity` elements in the same `SequenceFlow`.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow's Groovy script "Log_Discarded_Message.groovy" and "Log_Exception_Async.groovy" may be creating attachments for successful messages using `messageLogFactory`. Without the script content, this is only a potential risk, but warrants further review.
   
- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iFlow does not appear to process files directly.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an HTTPS endpoint and is configured to use "RoleBased" authentication with the role `ESBMessaging.send` which is externalized. Further investigation is needed to confirm that basic authentication is disabled as expected, since the iflow configuration may be insecure if basic authentication is enabled.
