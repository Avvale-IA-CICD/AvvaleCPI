**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.1

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow contains `callActivity` steps with generic names such as "Set Headers" and "Custom Status". These should be renamed to better reflect their specific purpose.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iFlow uses standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` in multiple steps, which is good for monitoring.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iFlow uses custom headers like `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus` which enhances payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The `metainfo.prop` file contains `source`, `target`, and `description`, fulfilling the metadata requirement.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_R`. This name should follow Java notation using dots instead of underscores or hyphens.  For example, it should be like `com.repsol.seda.model`.

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iFlow externalizes parameters like `SEDA_MAIN_QUEUE`, `MaxRetries`, `Expiration Period`, `Maximum Retry Interval`, `Retention Threshold 4 Alerting`, `Retry Interval`, and `Number of Concurrent Processes` which are important for configuration.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iFlow implements error handling using Error Subprocesses and `Log Async Exception` activities in almost all steps.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow uses a groovy script `script1.groovy` that throws a Dummy Exception, which in principle is ok, but further evaluation is needed.
   The iFlow uses scripts like "Log_Discarded_Message.groovy", "Log_Exception_Async.groovy". It is neccesary to evaluate the content of those scripts to ensure that they are not using clases from these packages com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore. If positive note that this might represent a security issue

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
   The iFlow appears to be well-organized, with no single `SequenceFlow` containing more than 10 `callActivity` elements.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses "Log Async Exception" and "Log Discarded Message" which might create attachments for successful messages using `messageLogFactory` during groovy scripting. This could represent a security/resource consumption issue. Only failed messages should be logged, normally in exception process.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
   This check may not apply because no IDoc processing is explicitly mentioned in the provided data.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
   This check may not apply because no file processing is explicitly mentioned in the provided data.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
   The iFlow exposes an HTTPS endpoint (`/seda/start/jms`) and uses `ESBMessaging.send` role. It췂s neccesary to check in configured values, that the iflow not is configured to allow Basic Auth.
