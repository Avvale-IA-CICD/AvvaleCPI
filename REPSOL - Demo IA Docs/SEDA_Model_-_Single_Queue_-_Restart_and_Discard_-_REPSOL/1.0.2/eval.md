**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.2

**Best Practices Summary**
- **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    Some `callActivity` elements such as "Custom Status" and "Set Headers" could have more descriptive names.

- **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow uses standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` in several steps.

- **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow uses `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus` which is a custom header, but could be improved enhancing payload search and filtering.

- **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains values for source, target, and description.

- **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_R EPSOL`. It should use a java class style notation (e.g., `com.example.iflow`).

- **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow externalizes several parameters, including queue names, retry intervals, and expiration periods.

- **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow implements error handling using error sub-processes in each integration process to handle exceptions, set custom status and log errors.

- **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow doesn't use the classes `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` in groovy scripts.

- **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\
    No single `SequenceFlow` contains more than 10 `callActivity` elements.

- **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\
    The iFlow doesn't seem to be creating attachments in groovy scripts for successful messages using `messageLogFactory`.

- **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow doesn't appear to be processing IDocs.

- **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\
    The iflow doesn't appear to be processing files.

- **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with HTTPS Sender Adapter and uses `ESBMessaging.send` role, it's recommended to avoid basic auth.
