**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.2

**Best Practices Summary**
-   **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The iFlow contains "callActivity" steps with generic names like "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Set Headers", "Custom Status", "Log Async Exception".  These should be named more descriptively to improve readability.

-   **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow uses standard headers like `SAP_Sender`, `SAP_Receiver`, and `SAP_MessageType` for monitoring.

-   **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The iFlow uses `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus` and the property `Step` as custom header for filtering/monitoring but it can be enhanced with other custom headers that enhance payload search and filtering.

-   **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The `metainfo.prop` file contains `source`, `target`, and `description` metadata.

-   **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The `Bundle-SymbolicName` in `MANIFEST.MF` is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_R EPSOL`.  It should follow Java notation (e.g., `com.repsol.seda.model`).

-   **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow externalizes parameters such as queue names (`SEDA_MAIN_QUEUE`), retry intervals (`Retry Interval`, `Maximum Retry Interval`), and retry count (`MaxRetries`).

-   **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow implements error handling with error subprocesses in steps 1, 2, 3, and the router, logging async exceptions, and setting custom statuses.

-   **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow does not use classes from packages `com.sap.it.api.securestore` or `com.sap.it.api.keystore` in groovy scripts, so there췂s no security issues.

-   **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow does not have SequenceFlow containing more than 10 "callActivity".

-   **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow doesn췂t creating attachments for succesful messages during groovy scripting.

-   **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\\n
    The iFlow doesn't handle IDoc messages.

-   **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\\n
    The iFlow doesn't handle files.

-   **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with the HTTPS sender adapter and uses the ESBMessaging.send role. Although `enableBasicAuthentication` is set to `false`, confirm that Basic Authentication is entirely disabled at the tenant level. Consider alternative authentication methods for enhanced security.
