**iFlowId**: SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_REPSOL - **iFlowVersion**: 1.0.2

**Best Practices Summary**
-   **Iflow Steps Naming** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow steps appear to be reasonably named, with no generic names like "Sender" or "Receiver" detected in the callActivity elements.

-   **Monitoring Standard Headers** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow uses standard headers such as SAP_Sender, SAP_Receiver, and SAP_MessageType, which aids in monitoring.

-   **Monitoring Custom Headers** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The analysis cannot confirm the presence of custom headers specifically designed to enhance payload search and filtering. Further inspection is needed.

-   **Iflow Metadata** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The metainfo.prop file contains values for source, target, and description.

-   **Iflow Id** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The Bundle-SymbolicName in the MANIFEST.MF file is `SEDA_Model_-_Single_Queue_-_Restart_and_Discard_-_R EPSOL`. This uses underscores and hyphens which is not according to java notation.
    
-   **Parameter Externalization** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow externalizes parameters like queue names, retry intervals, and expiration periods.

-   **Error Handling** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow includes error handling mechanisms with exception subprocesses and logging for asynchronous exceptions.

-   **Local Script Security** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The groovy scripts do not contain the com.sap.it.api.securestore or com.sap.it.api.keystore packages.

-   **Iflow Organization** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow does not appear to have an excessive number of call activities within a single sequence flow.

-   **Iflow Attachments** -> 游릭 Ok\\n
    The iFlow does not log attachments for succesful messages.

-   **IDoc Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\\n
    The iFlow does not appear to handle IDoc messages.

-   **File Rules** -> 游리 Does not apply\\n
    The iFlow does not appear to handle file messages.

-   **Inbound Endpoint Rules** -> 游댮 Check Required\\n
    The iFlow exposes an endpoint with HTTPS Sender Adapter and uses `ESBMessaging.send` role, which is considered insecure, and the iflow is not configured to allow Basic Auth.
